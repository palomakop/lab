# ⚗️ welcome to my <span class="fade-text-a">laboratory</span><span class="fade-text-b">labyrinth</span>

**this is the wild frontier section of my website, where experiments happen.**

browse with caution. things might be broken, half-baked, ugly, or depend on experimental browser features. this is where ideas can come out to play, without pressure to be perfect or polished.

<div class="scene" id="atrium">

## you find yourself in an atrium with concrete walls.

**&gt;&gt;** there is a light switch on the wall near the entrance. it's currently switched <span class="display-dark">off</span><span class="display-light">on</span>. <span id="on-switch"><a href="javascript:toggleColorScheme();">turn on the lights</a></span><span id="off-switch"><a href="javascript:toggleColorScheme();">turn off the lights</a></span>

**&gt;&gt;** a swirling portal behind you leads to the relative safety of the <a href="https://palomakop.tv" target="_blank">main site</a>

**&gt;&gt;** you see a desk with a scroll of paper lying on it. the top of the page reads <a href="https://palomakop.tv/recurse" target="_blank">recurse center log</a>

**&gt;&gt;** a pair of x-ray goggles is sitting on the desk. put them on to view the source code on <a href="https://github.com/palomakop/lab" target="_blank">the repo</a>

**&gt;&gt;** a large metal door stands before you. open it to [enter the lab](#hallway) at your own risk...
