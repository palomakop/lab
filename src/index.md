# ⚗️ welcome to my lab

**this is the wild frontier section of my website, where experiments happen.**

browse with caution. things might be broken, half-baked, ugly, or depend on experimental browser features. this is where ideas can come out to play, without pressure to be perfect or polished.

## you can:

**&gt;&gt;** return to the relative safety of the <a href="https://palomakop.tv" target="_blank">main site</a>

**&gt;&gt;** read my <a href="https://palomakop.tv/recurse" target="_blank">recurse center log</a>

**&gt;&gt;** continue to browse the lab at your own risk... (hmm, there is not much to see yet, come back later)
