# ⚗️ welcome to my lab

**this is the wild frontier section of my website, where experiments happen.**

browse with caution. things might be broken, half-baked, ugly, or depend on experimental browser features. this is where ideas can come out to play, without pressure to be perfect or polished.

## you find yourself in a small vestibule with concrete walls.

**&gt;&gt;** a swirling portal behind you leads to the relative safety of the <a href="https://palomakop.tv" target="_blank">main site</a>

**&gt;&gt;** you see a desk with a scroll of paper lying on it. the top of the page reads <a href="https://palomakop.tv/recurse" target="_blank">recurse center log</a>

**&gt;&gt;** a pair of x-ray goggles is sitting on the desk. put them on to <a href="https://github.com/palomakop/lab" target="_blank">view the source code on the repo</a>

**&gt;&gt;** continue to explore the lab at your own risk...

## you see a door marked "shaders."

**&gt;&gt;** [open it!](/shaders)
